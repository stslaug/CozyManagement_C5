    from up north, far from here, where the snow's crisp and the air\u2019s sharp.
    \nI\u2019ve been tryin' to make the perfect snowcones, the kind that taste like
    fresh mountain air. \nBut down here, the snow just ain\u2019t right.\nI need
    something special to really freeze the flavor in, like the snow back home. \nYou
    got any plants \u2018round here that could help me with that? "
